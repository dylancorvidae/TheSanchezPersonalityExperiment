# ThinkShout Questions
1. What was the goal and what were the requirements?

2. How does the work meet (or not meet) the goal and requirements?

3. How does it work? (big picture: think about how you would describe this to someone who was going to review the code or add functionality, to get them started) 

4. Who did you work on this with, and which parts were you responsible for? (If there is no commit or ticket history to review, please be extra explicit here)

5. If you were to do it again, what would you do differently? OR If you could spend more time, what would you add/improve? 

6. How do I run this code on my own webserver so I can try it out?

In this ultra-consumerist reality that we currently find ourselves in, the only respite from the constant barrage to output more, create more, be more, is to dull our brains with mindless entertainment.  Our app is meant to bring you peace through comedy and give you a break from the monotony of the ultra-capitalistic society we live in.
